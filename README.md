# Description
- This is a two-player (though you are free to play by yourself if you wish) split-screen co-op arcade game. This was developed for the University of St Andrews CS4303 module "Video Games" as a group project and final submission. This was developed in a team of 3.
- The game was built using Processing 4.0.
# Features
- The game features: procedural generation of solar systems per-run, friendly and enemy AI, and planetary gravity.
- The goal of the game is to meet target point quotas every 2 minutes. If you succeed, the difficulty increases and the target increases likewise.
- You and your partner move around the solar system trying to fulfill as many missions as possible (points awarded proportional to difficulty and degree of success). You cannot do everything by yourself, so communication and cooperation is key!
- Hazards: meteors move and collide with eachother, and can hurt you. Enemy ships patrol the solar system and will target you and any friendly AI following you. If you die, you will need to wait to be respawned.
# Missions
- The key goal is to complete as many missions as possible. The two mission types are Cargo and Escort. Cargo involves taking a resource from one planet to another. Escort involves taking as many friendly AI with you to another/other planet/planets.
